#Style Me
Style Me is a chrome extension for adding any hosted css files into webpage. 

####Features:
 - Add multiple links of your stylesheets.
 - Enable/disable usage of your stylesheets.
 - Autoupdate your links with specified frequency.

####Why it was implemented:
  Sometimes we have to add some styles to existing websites. And to be honest "sometimes" we don't have dev branch or even ftp access to website files. U're lucky if u didn't have such tasks ;) So with this extension we could just add a link to a hosted css-file, turn on "Enable" option and see our styles applied to a webpage.
  Want some automatic update? Just enable "Autoupdate" option* and set preferable update frequency in seconds. 

*Note: it takes some time depending on your internet connection to load and apply your styles into webpage. For development just use any local server so your files will load immediately.
